# Agent Instructions for Init Repository

## Build/Test Commands
This is a minimal Git repository with no build system configured yet.
- No package.json, Cargo.toml, or other build configuration files found
- No test framework detected
- No lint/format tools configured

## Code Style Guidelines
Since this is an empty repository, follow these general best practices:
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for web projects, 4 for Python)
- Follow language-specific naming conventions (camelCase for JS/TS, snake_case for Python)
- Add proper error handling with try/catch or Result types
- Use TypeScript for JavaScript projects when possible
- Import statements should be organized: built-ins, third-party, local modules
- Add JSDoc/docstrings for public functions and complex logic

## Repository Notes
- This is a new/empty repository with only Plan.md
- No existing code style to follow
- No Cursor rules (.cursorrules) or Copilot instructions found
- Git repository initialized but no source code present

## Next Steps for Agents
- Check if project type can be determined from user requirements
- Follow language-specific conventions when code is added
- Set up appropriate build/test tools based on chosen technology stack
