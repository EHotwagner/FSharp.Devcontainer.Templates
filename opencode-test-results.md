## Test Summary
**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Status:** ✅ PASSED with Official Installation
**OpenCode Version:** 0.5.27 (Real CLI)

## Updates Made

### 1. Official Installation Methods Implemented
- **Primary:** Official install script (`curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`)
- **Secondary:** npm package (`npm install -g opencode-ai`)
- **Tertiary:** Homebrew (`brew install sst/tap/opencode`)
- **Fallback:** Direct binary download from GitHub releases

### 2. Installation Method Priority
1. **Official Script** - Primary method using opencode.ai install script
2. **npm** - For Node.js environments
3. **Homebrew** - For macOS/Linux with brew
4. **Binary Download** - Direct from GitHub releases with architecture detection
5. **Mock CLI** - Development fallback only

### 3. Feature Configuration Updated
- Changed default install method from "npm" to "official"
- Added "homebrew" as installation option
- Updated documentation URLs to official docs
- Enhanced error handling and fallback logic

## Test Results

### ✅ Official Installation Method

- F#-specific configuration
- VS Code integration settings
- Authentication templates

## Installation Methods Tested

| Method | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Official Script | ✅ Working | Primary method, downloads latest binary |
| npm | ✅ Fallback | Falls back to official script if npm package fails |
| Homebrew | ✅ Available | Requires `brew tap sst/tap` first |
| Binary Download | ✅ Working | Direct GitHub releases with arch detection |

## Key Improvements

1. **Real CLI Integration**: No longer uses mock implementation
2. **Robust Fallbacks**: Multiple installation methods with intelligent fallback
3. **Architecture Detection**: Proper x64/arm64 binary selection
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if methods fail
5. **Official Documentation**: Updated URLs and descriptions

## Authentication Requirements

To use OpenCode:
1. Run `opencode auth login`
2. Select a provider (Anthropic Claude recommended)
3. Configure API keys
4. Start using with `opencode` in project directory

## Production Readiness

**Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY**

The OpenCode CLI feature now:
- Uses official installation methods
- Installs the real OpenCode v0.5.27 CLI
- Provides full AI-powered development assistance
- Supports multiple installation fallbacks
- Includes comprehensive VS Code integration
- Works with F#, TypeScript, and other languages

## Next Steps

1. Users can authenticate with their preferred AI provider
2. Initialize projects with `/init` command
3. Use AI assistance for code completion, analysis, and development
4. Leverage VS Code integration for seamless workflow

The feature is now ready for production use with real AI-powered development capabilities.
